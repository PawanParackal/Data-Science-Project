"The data in this report are reliant on the provision of data from states and territories to the Australian Government Department of Health. Backlogs in notifications at the state or territory level may contribute to delays in reporting to the NNDSS. Notifications for some high volume conditions are only uploaded quarterly by some jurisdictions, which can result in apparent large variability over time.

Data in this report are subject to retrospective revision and may vary from data reported in published NNDSS reports and reports of notification data by states and territories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
