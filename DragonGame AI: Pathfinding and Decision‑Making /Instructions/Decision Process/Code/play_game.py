play_game.py

Running this file launches an interactive game session. Becoming familiar with the game mechanics may be helpful in
designing your solution.

The script takes 1 argument:
- input_filename, which must be a valid testcase file (e.g. one of the provided files in the testcases directory)

When prompted for an action, type one of the available action strings (e.g. wr, wl, etc) and press enter to perform the
entered action.
