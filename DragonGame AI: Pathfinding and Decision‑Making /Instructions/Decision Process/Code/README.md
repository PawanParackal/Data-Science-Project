# Assignment 2 Support Code

This is the support code for COMP3702 Assignment 2 "Dragon Game".

The following files are provided:

**game_env.py**

This file contains a class representing an Untitled Dragon Game level environment, storing the dimensions of the
environment, initial player position, exit position, number of gems and position of each gem, transition probabilities
for glide, superjump and supercharge actions, and targets for reward, runtime, number of iterations, etc.

This file contains a number of functions which will be useful in developing your solver:

~~~~~
__init__(filename)
~~~~~
Constructs a new instance based on the given input filename.


~~~~~
get_init_state()
~~~~~
Returns a GameState object (see below) representing the initial state of the level.


~~~~~
perform_action(state, action)
~~~~~
Simulates/samples an outcome of performing the given 'action' starting from the given 'state', where 'action' is an
element of GameEnv.ACTIONS and 'state' is a GameState object. Returns a tuple (valid, reward, next_state, is_terminal), 
where valid is boolean value (indicating whether the selected action is valid), reward is a floating point value 
indicating the immediate reward received, next_state is a GameState object indicating the resulting next state, and
is_terminal is a boolean value indicating whether the end of episode occurred.


~~~~~
is_solved(state)
~~~~~
Checks whether the given 'state' (a GameState object) is solved (i.e. all gems collected and player at exit). Returns
True (solved) or False (not solved).


~~~~~
is_game_over(state)
~~~~~
Checks whether the given 'state' (a GameState object) results in Game Over (i.e. player has landed on a lava tile).
Returns True (Game Over) or False (not Game Over).


~~~~~
render(state)
~~~~~
Prints a graphical representation of the given 'state' (a GameState object) to the terminal - you may find this useful 
for debugging.


**game_state.py**

This file contains a class representing an Untitled Dragon Game state, storing the position of the player and the status
of all gems in the level (1 for collected, 0 for remaining).

~~~~~
__init__(row, col, gem_status)
~~~~~
Constructs a new GameState instance, where row and column are integers between 0 and n_rows, n_cols respectively, and
gem_status is a tuple of length n_gems, where each element is 1 or 0.


**play_game.py**

This file contains a script which launches an interactive game session when run. Becoming familiar with the game
mechanics may be helpful in designing your solution.

The script takes 1 command line argument:
- input_filename, which must be a valid testcase file (e.g. one of the provided files in the testcases directory)

When prompted for an action, type one of the available action strings (e.g. wr, wl, etc) and press enter to perform the
entered action (make sure the terminal and not the display window is selected when entering actions).


**solution.py**

Template file for you to implement your solution to Assignment 1.

You should implement each of the method stubs contained in this file. You may add additional methods and/or classes to
this file if you wish. You may also create additional source files and import to this file if you wish.

We recommend you implement UCS first, then attempt A* after your UCS implementation is working.


**tester.py**

This file contains a script which can be used to debug and/or evaluate your solution.

The script takes up to 3 command line arguments:
- search_type, which should be "vi" or "pi"
- testcase_filename, which must be a valid testcase file (e.g. one of the provided files in the testcases directory)
- (optional) "-v" to enable visualisation of the resulting trajectory


**testcases**

A directory containing input files which can be used to evaluate your solution.

The format of a testcase file is:
~~~~~
n_rows, n_cols
gamma, epsilon
VI time targets (min score target, max score target)
PI time targets (min score target, max score target)
VI iterations targets (min score target, max score target)
PI iterations targets (min score target, max score target)
reward target
glide probabilities
super jump probabilities
super charge probabilities
ladder fall probability
collision penalty
game over penalty
episode seed
grid data
~~~~~

Testcase files can contain comments, starting with '#', which are ignored by the input file parser.
