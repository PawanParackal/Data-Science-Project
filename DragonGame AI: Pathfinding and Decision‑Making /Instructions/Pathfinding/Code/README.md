# Assignment 1 Support Code

This is the support code for COMP3702 Assignment 1 "Dragon Game".

The following files are provided:

**game_env.py**

This file contains a class representing an Untitled Dragon Game level environment, storing the dimensions of the
environment, initial player position, exit position, number of gems and position of each gem, targets for path cost, run
time and number of nodes expanded, the tile type of each grid position, and a list of all available actions.

This file contains a number of functions which will be useful in developing your solver:

~~~~~
__init__(filename)
~~~~~
Constructs a new instance based on the given input filename.


~~~~~
get_init_state()
~~~~~
Returns a GameState object (see below) representing the initial state of the level.


~~~~~
perform_action(state, action)
~~~~~
Simulates the outcome of performing the given 'action' starting from the given 'state', where 'action' is an element of
GameEnv.ACTIONS and 'state' is a GameState object. Returns a tuple (success, next_state), where success is True (if the
action is valid and does not collide) or False (if the action is invalid or collides), and next_state is a GameState
object.


~~~~~
is_solved(state)
~~~~~
Checks whether the given 'state' (a GameState object) is solved (i.e. all gems collected and player at exit). Returns
True (solved) or False (not solved).


~~~~~
is_game_over(state)
~~~~~
Checks whether the given 'state' (a GameState object) results in Game Over (i.e. player has landed on a lava tile).
Returns True (Game Over) or False (not Game Over).


~~~~~
render(state)
~~~~~
Prints a graphical representation of the given 'state' (a GameState object) to the terminal - you may find this useful 
for debugging.


**game_state.py**

This file contains a class representing an Untitled Dragon Game state, storing the position of the player and the status
of all gems in the level (1 for collected, 0 for remaining).

~~~~~
__init__(row, col, gem_status)
~~~~~
Constructs a new GameState instance, where row and column are integers between 0 and n_rows, n_cols respectively, and
gem_status is a tuple of length n_gems, where each element is 1 or 0.


**play_game.py**

This file contains a script which launches an interactive game session when run. Becoming familiar with the game
mechanics may be helpful in designing your solution.

The script takes 1 command line argument:
- input_filename, which must be a valid testcase file (e.g. one of the provided files in the testcases directory)

When prompted for an action, type one of the available action strings (e.g. wr, wl, etc) and press enter to perform the
entered action (make sure the terminal and not the display window is selected when entering actions).


**solution.py**

Template file for you to implement your solution to Assignment 1.

You should implement each of the method stubs contained in this file. You may add additional methods and/or classes to
this file if you wish. You may also create additional source files and import to this file if you wish.

We recommend you implement UCS first, then attempt A* after your UCS implementation is working.


**tester.py**

This file contains a script which can be used to debug and/or evaluate your solution.

The script takes up to 3 command line arguments:
- search_type, which should be "ucs" or "a_star"
- testcase_filename, which must be a valid testcase file (e.g. one of the provided files in the testcases directory)
- (optional) "-v" to enable visualisation of the resulting trajectory


**testcases**

A directory containing input files which can be used to evaluate your solution.

The format of a testcase file is:
~~~~~
num_rows, num_cols
cost targets (min score target, max score target)
nodes targets (min score target, max score target)
UCS run time targets (min score target, max score target)
A* run time targets (min score target, max score target)
grid_data (row 1)
...
grid_data (row num_rows)
~~~~~

Testcase files can contain comments, starting with '#', which are ignored by the input file parser.
