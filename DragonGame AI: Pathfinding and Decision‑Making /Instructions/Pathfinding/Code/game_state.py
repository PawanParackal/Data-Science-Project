    Instance of an Untitled Dragon Game state. row and col represent the current player position. gem_status is 1 for
    each collected gem, and 0 for each remaining gem.

    You may use this class and its functions. You may add your own code to this class (e.g. get_successors function,
    get_heuristic function, etc), but should avoid removing or renaming existing variables and functions to ensure
    Tester functions correctly.
